# Hi everyone! 

First session of the:

F# using .NET Core with SDK Development group 


TASK 1: a better name :D

---

    
# .NET detailed roadmap

1. .NET on windows (VS/msbuild/clr)
2. *magic* during X months
3. XPLAT .NET!

---

## .NET on windows

Your .NET App:

- use primitives classes like array/string (from Clr)
- use some classes from the Base Class Libraries (a collection of assemblies), like System.IO.dll
- use other specific assemblies maybe.
- use your code, compiled in an assembly/executable as IL (intermediate language)

---

##  .NET on windows - big components

RUNTIME = Clr, common language runtime. GC, Basic classes, etc

Where i can find the additional assemblies? i just reference "System.IO" assembly.
Two places:

1. machine global: GAC, global assembly cache.
2. local path: specific location

Other options:

- Project references: it's just the path of output assembly, so like `2` 
- nuget packages. Zip files of assemblies. Each packages is downloaded from internet into a local cache
    - A single zip contains multiple directory, each for every supported framework.
    - Each target framework has a name (like `.NET 4.6` and a moniker ( like `net46` ) 
    - so is just like `2`, a `local path`

---

## .NET on windows - how running an .exe works

How running a `test1.exe` works on windows ( https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k5532s8a(v=vs.110).aspx )

1. Windows see `test1.exe` is a managed app (it's a flag in the file)
2. Windows load `mscoree.dll` (Microsoft .NET Runtime Execution Engine) and change the entry point to the one in runtime
3. the entry point in runtime do:
    1. jit compile the assembly (IL -> machine instructions)
    2. find the managed main
    3. execute it

On unix/mac, you need to do `mono test1.exe`, because there is no `1` and `2`.

So there is always a runtime execution engine, and a .net executable is similar to a library (with a trick :D )

That's importnat because for .net core, something should run your application too!

---


# History of *magic*

Instead of write current status i'll do a fast history, because each feature it's the result
of a feedback of previous experiements.
I think is easier like that because hacking the sdk/netcore touch some legacy too.
Knowing history make easier to see the roadmap of sdk/netcore and foundamental topics.

The .NET Core is a bootstrap of the entire runtime/bcl/compilers/tooling in other os.
With lots of lesson from community feedback too.

First rule:
- You cannot use something if doesnt work.

For tools/everything:
- Create semplified tool/lib and what you need to make progress.
- Reevaluate from time to time if progress make possible to use the real tools. Or are not needed anymore.

---

## Project K (Q2 2014)

Started by ASP.NET Team, first avaiabile code in Q2 2014 ( http://davidfowl.com/asp-net-vnext/ )
Github: https://github.com/aspnet/Home

It's the next big aspnet iteration. 
Restart from zero, same name, really different implementation.
Xplat (.NET on win, unix/osx with mono). 
Lots of new ideas to simplify asp.net dev.

Main Ideas:

- NuGet packages are the unit of reference (not assemblies)
- Projects and NuGet packages are interchangeable. Projects can depend on packages and packages can depend on projects.
- First class ability to produce NuGet packages from the project system.
- OSS by default
- Side by side runtimes
- Human readable and easy to author project files with default conventions.

---

## Project K (Q2 2014) - 2

Main ideas, but dropped later:
- Runtime compilation; building a binary on disk isn't required to run (using Roslyn).
- Ability to change code and f5 in the browser without an explicit build step.
- No strong naming

Tools:

- KRE - K Runtime Environment
    - All the following tools,script required and useful for development
- KVM - K Version Manager
    - Let's download all the runtime/package needed from internet. Easy upgrade, manage parallel installs.
- KPM - K Package Manager
    - I need to download the nuget packages from internet! manage local cache!
- KLR - K runtime
    - The entry point to abstract the execution if on windows or on mono, used like `klr myapp.exe`.
    That's the single exe who replace `mscoreee`, to find the entry point and run it.

---

## Project K (Q2 2014) - 3

Project System:

- similar to nodejs (aspnet is a web team..)
- a plain json file (`project.json`) where tools can read source files, refs, etc
- conventions and defaults!
- first class support for dependencies from nuget packages
- easy multiple target framework support, not like csproj/msbuild
- easy project => nuget package, so there are options for nuspec fields (like authors), etc

Nuget TFM: 
- added `aspnetcore50`

---

# .NET Open source (Q4 2014)

Microsoft say who .NET is going open source!
The .NET Core ( coreclr/bcl/compilers ) are going to be xplat!
https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2014/11/12/net-core-is-open-source/

Work starts:

- porting of CLR -> CoreClr (https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr)
- porting of BCL -> as nuget packages (https://github.com/dotnet/corefx)
- porting of compilers ->
  - csc/vbc for c#/vb (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn)
  - fsc for f# (https://github.com/microsoft/visualfsharp/)

But that's just runtime, bcl and compiler. 

When done, you can only invoke the compiler from command line, passing arguments (source files,names,path to assemblies, etc) and generating
a library/executable.

That's not how we work usually, very few invoke the compiler by hand.

---

# .NET Open source (Q4 2014) - I dont invoke the compiler directly!

The rest of tools?

- I dont want to repeat myself, where i write the source files list?
- The references? that's boring and often versions (and paths) change!
- Compiler define? Release? Debug? Exe name? output directory?

We need a project system! Something where i can write my source files list, references, etc (same function of .fsproj)

Meanwhile `Project K` added Coreclr support.

So now `Project K` support three runtimes (.net clr, coreclr, mono) with same tools

---

## K -> DNX (Q1 2015)

`K` is renamed to `DNX` (https://github.com/aspnet/Home/issues/261)

VS Support with an wrapper `myproject.xproj` prject file. Just load the vs extension who read the `project.json`.

TFM deprecated `aspnetcore50`, added `dnxcore50`

Tools changed/renamed:

- `KLR` -> `dnx`
- `KRE` -> `dnx`
- `KVM` -> `dnvm`
- `kpm` -> `nuget`

Because now the `nuget.exe` client can:

- run xplat 
- has a local cache (`K` use lots of packages, everything is a package!!)
- understand project.json

The custom kpm tool is dropped.

So a simple tool `kpm` is replaced by the original tool `nuget`, now cross platform and enhanced.

---

## K -> DNX (Q1 2015) - NOTES and PAINS

Some features added are make it a bit difficult the migration from normal libraries/console app,

For example:

- the entry point `dnx` choose the `Main` of application from a `commands` list inside `project.json`.
- A `project.json` is always required. 

Remember the main use case is as web app, who can have additional commands (console app) for utilities

So works ok for libraries/web but is a bit annoying for console app.


---

## K -> DNX (Q1 2015) - F# work start!

F# work is started by @Alxandr in https://github.com/fsprojects/fsharp-dnx

The `RC2` version works, but we see the initial friction because `dnx` has some special design decision.

Some are good features, but the initial decision to use `roslyn as a service` instead of `csc`, create a tight coupling with
roslyn compiler (so hard for F#)

- Compilation in memory. The f# compiler support only files, as workaround streams are saved and loaded.
  - i started a pr in `microsoft/visualfsharp` to support that, but never merged (i will rebase sometimes later, can be useful maybe)
- `ANI` (Assembly Netrual Interfaces) aka `Structural Equivalence of Interfaces` is a feature built on top of roslyn. not supported by f# compiler or by Clr directly.

---

## .NET CLI (Q3 2015)

GOAL: Create an easy to use command line interface toolkit https://github.com/dotnet/cli

The sdk it's used invoking an console app. `dotnet`.

The sdk use lessons learned in k/dnx/aspnet, because works and devs like it!
But the main use case is a bit different: library and console app.

- reuse the `project.json` format because works, is clean/easy and integrated in VS already.
- multi target framework
- create a `dotnet` command, with subcommand for normal use case:
  - `dotnet new` -> templates
  - `dotnet restore` -> restore package (= nuget)
  - `dotnet build` -> read `project.json` and call compilers
  - `dotnet run` -> execute it, abstract runtime choosen (clr, coreclr, mono)
  - `dotnet publish` -> put in a directory the compiled exe plus dependencies (xplat deploy).

F# works starts: https://github.com/enricosada/fsharp-dotnet-cli-samples/wiki/Changelog#100001494-first-lkg

---

## .NET CLI (Q3 2015) - How running a console app works?

How running a console app works? there is no more a `klr.exe`. Who is the runtime execution engine?
There is `corehost.exe` (native executable, one for every OS!!) and a trick.

You console app is compiled to `myapp.dll` (No windows tricks like in .NET fake .exe).
To run it, you can do `corehost.exe myapp.dll` (that's what `dotnet myapp.dll` does)

But after `dotnet publish` there is a `myapp.exe`? how is that possible?
It's a trick.

- On `dotnet publish` the `corehost.exe` is copied inside outdir and renamed as `myapp.exe`
- The `myapp.exe` is near `myapp.dll` (your app)
- when invoked, `myapp.exe` search for a `.dll` with same name in the directory, and run it.
- so `corehost myapp.dll` is exactly like `myapp.exe`, but feel native in each os

Better than `mono myapp.exe`, because it can be xcopy deployed, and is just a normal native app for users!.

---

## .NET Standard (Q4 2015) - PCL

ref https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/09/26/introducing-net-standard/

Previous state of the art: 

To support multiple different implementation of platform (mean runtimes and BCL and names like ios, win8, uwp), new portable profiles are added.

Each portable profile just **pick** some api, and works in defined set of of environemt (so "wp8+wp7+ios" = "profile123" for example)

Problem are:

- if tomorrow a new a bit different platform is added, for example "wp9", your package cannot by used by default.
- proliferation of target frameworks.
- package authors try to use the minimal set of features, and development is hard (missing api).
- if you want to use a library as dependecy, must be pcl compliant too. so fewer packages avaiabile => less packages created.

---

## .NET Standard (Q4 2015) - NetStandard

To make easier stuff, a new horizonal target framework is created

- `netstandard` = `.Net Standard`

And is *versioned*.

Some info https://github.com/davidfowl/NetStandard and analogy https://github.com/davidfowl/NetStandard/blob/master/platforms.cs

`netstandard` started small, adding new api each version.

So `netstandard1.3` <= `netstandard1.5` <= `netstandard1.6` 

**Semver compliant**. 

The `netstandard2.0` will be a breaking change, but in reality doesnt matter, because the platforms already implement the `netstandard2.0` api.

Each framework implementation = platform (mono, .net, .net core) version will say what is his compatibility.
It' the framework maintainers job to be compliant.

---

## .NET Standard (Q4 2015) - Example

For example `.NET 4.6` platform is compatibile at max with `netstandard1.3`. 
to use `.netstandard1.4` you need `.NET 4.6.1`

And some implementation

- `netcoreapp1.0` = .Net Core App 1.0 = the console executable of .net core
- `net451` = the .NET 4.5.1

---

## .NET CLI beta (Q4 2015)

The `dnxcore50` tfm is obsolete, use `netstandard1.5` instead. 

It's possibile to import (that mean are included in restore) the `dnxcore50` in `netstandard1.5` to use packages built for `dnxcore50`

```json`
    "imports": [ "dnxcore50" ]
```

It's created a meta package (empty, but reference other packages) `Microsoft.NETCore.App` to group the most used deps for an app

F# works continue:

https://github.com/enricosada/fsharp-dotnet-cli-samples/wiki/Changelog#100-beta-002071-support-netstandard-xplat

- support `netstandard`, `netcoreapp1.0`
- xplat

---

## .NET CLI preview1, renamed as .NET Core SDK (Q2 2016)

Status: Tooling (cli) is less complete. 
the .net core is more complete.

Before the roadmap was unified (`beta`), now is splitted in two:

- `.NET Core` is RC2 (coreclr/bcl)
- `.NET CLI` is renamed to `.NET Core Sdk`, and is `preview1` (tooling)

ref https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/05/16/announcing-net-core-rc2/

---

### .NET Core SDK preview1 (Q2 2016) - F# works OOTB:

F# works OOTB!!

https://github.com/enricosada/fsharp-dotnet-cli-samples/wiki/Changelog#100-preview1-002702-stable-preview1-support-netstandard-15-xplat

And a new repo for `F# and Sdk` development is created https://github.com/dotnet/netcorecli-fsc

as usual it's always the `fsc` compiler used:

- project.json contains "compilerName: fsc"
- `dotnet build` call `dotnet-compile-fsc`
- `dotnet-compile-fsc` call `fsc`


---

## .NET Core SDK preview1 (Q2 2016) - sdk extensibility with tools

A new sdk extensibility model, `Tools`, is added to sdk!

A tool is declared in "tools" section, is inside a nuget packaged restored on `dotnet restore` step, and can 
be invoked by `dotnet mytool`.

```json
  "tools": {
    "dotnet-mytool": "1.0.*"
  },
```

It's just a normal `netcoreapp1.0` console app, named `dotnet-mytool` (convention is `dotnet-{name}`)

Anything with `dotnet-` prefix in `PATH` too, for example `dotnet-hello.bat` (or `.exe`, `.sh`), can be invoked like `dotnet hello`

We use that for example with `dotnet-compile-fsc`.

Other nice one: `dotnet-watch`.

---

## .NET Core SDK preview1 (Q2 2016) - `dotnet test`

Added `dotnet test` to abstract the test framework.

Use a different extensibility model, this implementation known the project file info, so for example the source files list.

Each test framework (nunit/xunit) author will create a new nuget package.

The nuget package is added to references, and loaded by `dotnet test`.

Unified command line for running test, for basic use case. 
Can pass additional test framework specific arguments obv.

the dotnet-test can serve an http server, so unified test runner too.

---

## .NET Core SDK preview1 (Q2 2016) - VS Code initial support

IONIDE team (@Krzysztof-Cieslak) add initial support.

The flow is:

- at `dotnet build` the `dotnet-compile-fsc` create a response file for the `fsc` at path `obj\Debug\netcoreapp1.0\dotnet-comopile-fsc.rsp`.
- that response files contains all the `fsc` arguments, enough for `Fsharp.Compiler.Service` to give intellisense.
- ionide initialize the `FCS` (throu `FsAutoComplete`) with content of response file.

But is partial:

- require at least one `dotnet build`, so `dotnet new && dotnet restore && code` doesnt give intellisense
- no multi framework support

---


## .NET Core SDK preview1 (Q2 2016) - additional notes

Asp.net drop dnx, and become a normal sdk console app.

`ASP.NET 5 RC1` is renamed as `ASP.NET Core RC2`, and deprecate the `dnx` toolking in favor of
the `.NET Core Sdk`.

That mean the new asp.net version is just a normal .net core sdk console app, using `netstandard` tfm.

Annoying migration from RC1 to RC2 for asp.net projects (that was a big issue online with RC1 users, and primary source of bad fame of .net core tooling)

It's an aspnet problem, no changes for `.NET Core Sdk` projects.

**Bonus point**: because is a normal sdk console app, aspnet projects works with F# too


More os supported: `Red Hat`, `Centos`, `Debian`, `Linux Mint`, `Windows Nano Server TP5`

---

## .NET Core Sdk preview2 (Q3 2016)

- `.NET Core 1.0` is RTM 
- `.NET Core Sdk` is preview2 ( 1.0.0-preview2-001131 )

ref https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/06/27/announcing-net-core-1-0/

F# works, but f# templates inside `dotnet new` are wrong. Ouch.

So partial OOTB experience.

Templates are published on https://github.com/dotnet/netcorecli-fsc/tree/master/examples/preview2 waiting for an new release of sdk

`dotnet-compile-fsc` is a normal sdk tool. Extensibility!

---

## .NET Core Sdk preview2 Update 1 (Q3 2016)

- `.NET Core 1.0.1` released
- `.NET Core Sdk` is preview2 ( 1.0.0-preview2-003131 )

ref https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/09/13/announcing-september-2016-updates-for-net-core-1-0/

F# templates in `dotnet new` fixed.

F# works OOTB.


---

## .NET Core Sdk preview3 (WIP) - project.json removed

**project.json support REMOVED**, that's it, DEAD, deprecated, removed, done.

Added a new msbuild based project system (csproj/fsproj).

Why? afaik :

- msbuild now open source and works xplat, so can be used. Before didnt exists this option.
- easier migration of existing project.
- more features/use cases. less bug/unsupported use case (remember project.json started with web as use case)
- msbuild/roslynworkspace cleanup. So new features added to msbuild, the one loved in `project.json`.
   - VS work in https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-project-system

---

## .NET Core Sdk preview3 (WIP) - use Msbuild instead

MSBuild 15 (https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild): open source, support .net core too

Major features:

- Extensibility of project system with msbuild target in nuget packages added on `dotnet restore` step
- MSBUILD: First class support for nuget package references ( `PackageReference` )
- Pretty much same features of `project.json` project system.
    - Nuget properties in fsproj for `dotnet pack`
- Support project 2 project `ProjectRefernce`. The rerefenced project can be a normal project, not a real package.

Notes:

- `project.json` project will migrate to `csproj` with a tool.
- `dotnet build` is pretty much msbuild invoked with `/t:Build` argument
- `dotnet msbuild` invoke msbuild.
- no `global.json`. the `dotnet restore` referenced project are found navigating by `ProjectReference`

---

## .NET Core Sdk preview3 (WIP) - F# status?

F# wip but works:

- examples in https://github.com/dotnet/netcorecli-fsc/tree/master/examples/preview3
- tests https://github.com/dotnet/netcorecli-fsc/tree/master/test-msbuild

---

## F# in preview3 (TODAY, TODO, ROADMAP)

Atm works like that.

The project (fsproj) add a reference to a package `FSharp.NET.Sdk` who includes some msbuild target files.

These target files are auto-imported after the first `dotnet-restore`.

The msbuild target on `Build` just invoke `dotnet compile-fsc` tool, like `preview2`, passing the 
arguments read from the fsproj.

---

## F# in preview3 - SDK INTEGRATION TODO: 

- Should use an msbuild task (auto-imported from same package) instead of a dotnet tool.
    - msbuild task exist already in microsfto/visualfsharp
- Should be possibile to run previous fsproj too
- Add comprensive test suite
- dotnet-new templates. WIP in dotnet/cli also the support for remote templates, downloaded from nuget packages!
- docs!
- migration of existing projects in ecosystem.
- FSI, fsharp interactive?

---

## F# in preview3 - IDE TODO:

- Atm a tool `ProjectCracker` is used to read msbuid project.
  -  Should be replaced or use the open source `msbuild` library.
    - Get graph of references from `ProjectReferecen`
    - Get arguments to initialize the `FSharp.Compiler.Service`
- Add Templates where useful
- Debugging! not supported yet!
- Help Ionide, FsAutoComplete
- Help VS, VFPT
- possibile goal: full .net core stack, no mono dependency?

---

## F# in preview3 - Community Ecosystem TODO:

- Help projects
  - Paket, both .net core and the integration with sdk
  - Fake
- Help migrate projects who works already in `preview2`
  - Suave (already works preview2)
  - Argu (already works preview2)
- Help finish migration of projects to `preview2` or `preview3`
  - FsCheck
- Help tooling projects
  - FsSrGen, FsLexYacc, FCS, FsAutoComplete
- Help compiler
  - Test Suite
